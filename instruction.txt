First, install XAMPP version v3.3.0, which includes:

PHP 8.1.12
MySQL

Next, install Composer and Node.js with the following versions:

Composer version 2.4.4
Node.js version v18.13.0

Navigate to C:\xampp\, open the xampp-control, and start both Apache and MySQL.

In your browser, open localhost/phpMyAdmin. Create a database named tailwebs and import the tailwebs.sql file that I shared.

Unzip the folder I provided into C:\xampp\htdocs\tailwebs.

If you already have MySQL credentials (username and password), ensure they are correctly added to the .env file for the database connection in the Laravel project.

Open the command prompt and run the following commands:

composer install
composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
npm install
npm run dev

Open your browser and navigate to localhost/tailwebs/public/login.
